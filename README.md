# SQLPortfolio
This is my SQL Portfolio.

.Generation1Pokemon is a project which focuses on querying data using aggregate functions, aliasing, CASE, HAVING, LIKE, WHERE, AND/OR functions, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY. 

.AsianArtists is a project focused on some of my favorite artists and creating relational databases and querying them. This project focuses on JOIN, PARTITION, UPDATE, ALTER, DELETE, CTE, Temp Tables, and VIEW.

For both, 1.TableCreations and 2.ModifyingDatabases, these are simple projects based on Khan Academy lessons in which are already covered in the above projects of .Generation1Pokemon and .AsianArtists.
